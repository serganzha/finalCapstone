## Project Name: Financial Calculator

## Description:
The Financial Calculator is a Python program that allows users to perform two types of calculations:
Investment - this option will calculate the amount of interest you'll earn on your investment
Bond - this option will calculate the amount you'll have to repay monthly on a home loan

The Investment option calculates the total amount of interest earned on a given investment. Users are prompted to enter the deposit amount, interest rate, and the investment duration in years. They can choose between simple and compound interest to view the final amount.

The Bond option calculates the monthly repayment amount for a home loan. Users need to input the present value of the house, the interest rate, and the duration of the bond in months.
